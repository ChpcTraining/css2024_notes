Let us visualize the data into plots, and no - we will not use matplotlib - it is too static and visually limited. We will use an interactive browser example like Plotly instead !

Example code:

```
import plotly.express as px

df = px.data.gapminder().query("continent=='Oceania'")
fig = px.line(df, x="year", y="lifeExp", color='country')
fig.write_html("plot.html")

import webbrowser
webbrowser.open("plot.html")
```

Let us see simple examples now to start off with:


# Lesson 1: Introduction to EDA and Data Exploration (Visualization, EDA sort of done in ETL too)

Objective: Introduce the importance of EDA and explore different aspects of the dataset.

Practical Task: Use Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to load a dataset and perform basic explorations. Teach students how to check data types, summary statistics, and identify key variables.

# Lesson 2: Data Visualization Techniques

Objective: Familiarize students with various data visualization techniques for understanding data distributions and relationships.

Practical Task: Create histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices using seaborn and matplotlib. Discuss how different visualizations reveal insights into the dataset.

# Lesson 3: Handling Missing Data and Outliers

Objective: Teach techniques for handling missing values and identifying outliers.

Practical Task: Use pandas for handling missing data through imputation or removal. Detect and visualize outliers using box plots or scatter plots. Discuss the impact of missing data on analysis.

# Lesson 4: Univariate and Bivariate Analysis

Objective: Explore the characteristics of individual variables and relationships between pairs of variables.

Practical Task: Conduct univariate analysis using descriptive statistics and visualizations. Explore bivariate relationships through scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation analysis.

# Lesson 5: Categorical Data Analysis

Objective: Understand how to analyze and visualize categorical data.

Practical Task: Use bar charts, pie charts, and count plots to analyze categorical variables. Discuss the importance of categorical data in real-world scenarios.

# Lesson 6: Advanced Data Visualization

Objective: Explore advanced data visualization techniques for complex datasets.

Practical Task: Implement heatmaps, 3D plots, and interactive visualizations using libraries like plotly. Discuss when and how to use advanced visualizations effectively.

# Lesson 7: Time Series Analysis

Objective: Introduce the analysis of time-dependent data.

Practical Task: Analyze time series data using line plots, seasonal decomposition, and autocorrelation plots. Discuss the challenges and considerations when dealing with time series data.

# Lesson 8: Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

Objective: Teach techniques like PCA for reducing the dimensionality of the dataset.

Practical Task: Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using scikit-learn to reduce the number of features in a dataset. Discuss the trade-offs and applications of dimensionality reduction.

# Lesson 9: EDA on Real-world Datasets

Objective: Apply EDA techniques to real-world datasets.

Practical Task: Provide students with a complex dataset and guide them through the entire EDA process. Emphasize interpretation of results and insights gained.
