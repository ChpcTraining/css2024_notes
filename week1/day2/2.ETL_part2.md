Extract:
Lesson 1: Extracting Data from Files
Objective: Understand how to extract data from different file formats using Python.

Practical Task: Extract data from a CSV file using the pandas library. Discuss different file formats (CSV, Excel, JSON) and demonstrate how to read each using appropriate Python libraries.
Lesson 2: Web Scraping for Data Extraction
Objective: Learn how to extract data from websites using web scraping techniques.

Practical Task: Use libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape data from a website. Emphasize the importance of understanding website structure and respecting terms of service.
Lesson 3: Connecting to Databases
Objective: Teach students how to extract data from databases using Python.

Practical Task: Connect to a PostgreSQL database using psycopg2 or an ORM like SQLAlchemy. Perform basic queries and retrieve data for analysis.
Transform:
Lesson 4: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Objective: Focus on cleaning and preprocessing extracted data for analysis.

Practical Task: Use pandas for tasks like handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types. Discuss the importance of data quality.
Lesson 5: Applying Data Transformations
Objective: Introduce transformations such as aggregations, merging, and filtering.

Practical Task: Demonstrate how to aggregate data using groupby in pandas. Merge datasets using different join types. Filter and manipulate data to create new variables.
Lesson 6: Implementing Advanced Transformations
Objective: Teach advanced transformations like pivot tables and custom functions.

Practical Task: Create a pivot table using pandas. Write custom functions to transform data based on specific requirements.
Load:
Lesson 7: Writing to Files and Databases
Objective: Understand how to load transformed data back into different storage systems.

Practical Task: Write transformed data to a CSV file, Excel file, and a PostgreSQL database. Discuss the benefits and considerations for each storage method.
Lesson 8: Automating ETL Pipelines
Objective: Learn how to automate ETL processes for efficiency.

Practical Task: Use tools like Apache Airflow or create simple Python scripts to automate ETL pipelines. Schedule tasks to run at specified intervals.
Lesson 9: Monitoring and Error Handling
Objective: Emphasize the importance of monitoring and handling errors in ETL processes.

Practical Task: Implement error handling mechanisms in a Python script. Use logging to track the progress of an ETL pipeline and handle exceptions.
Overall Project:
Lesson 10: Final Project
Objective: Apply all the ETL concepts learned in a comprehensive project.

Practical Task: Design and implement an end-to-end ETL pipeline for a real-world dataset. Include extraction from different sources, thorough data transformations, and loading into a database or file. Present and discuss the project in class.
Remember to encourage collaboration, provide opportunities for questions and problem-solving, and emphasize best practices throughout the lessons.
