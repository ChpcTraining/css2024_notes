# 2. Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)

In the previous lesson we were taught the basics of Python and how to read csv files in Python. 

Now before learning further Python skills, we need to discuss Excel spreadsheets, how they are used and some common issues. This is will help us better understand how to us Python as well and its advantages over spreadsheets.

## Isn't Excel Enough?

Well let us first discuss what most people researchers and professionals use spreadsheets for.

Spreadsheets are good for **date entry**. Therefore we have a lot of data in spreadsheets. Much of your time
is spent in the "data wrangling" stage or the "Extraction" part of ETL. It's not the most fun, but it is necessary. 

Mostly it is used for:

1. Data entry
2. Organizing data
3. Subsetting and sorting data
4. Statistics
5. Plotting

Let us try an poll on this in slack!

Many circumstances its quick and dirty option to produce calculations and figures to give you some idea of what your working with. Cleaning the data in a spreadsheet is a common task and is useful to put the data in a better format before analysing it. 

## Objectives

 "_Describe best practices for organizing data to make best use of them._"

Good data organization is the foundation of ones research project. Most researchers 

- Describe practices for more effective data wrangling to save time and effort and collaboration and thus more accesible to others.

## Down side of Spreadsheet

The most common mistake is that we treat spreadsheets like lab notebooks, that is relying on context, side notes, margins, spacial layouts and fields and metadata. We can usually interpret thiese things but computers don't view information in the same way. We need to explain to the computer what each step means. It can't firgure out how data is suppose to fit together.

They are good for data entry but tend to use spreadsheets for much more that it was cut out to do:
1. Create data tables for journal publications
2. Generate summary statistics 
3. Make figures

Generally not optimal requires special formatting or merging of cells. Also statistics and figures is almost impossible to replicate since of the drag and drop nature of it. Can't retrace your steps or clicks! Furthermore if you do calculations in spreadsheets its easy to accidently apply a slightly different formula to adjacent cells. When using script based programes like R or Python, its practically impossible to do that.
   Like data analysis for example. Data analysis usually requires a lot of manual work. To change a parameter or run an analysis with a new dataset you may have to redo everything by hand. There are macros but even with them, they are difficult to reproduce statistical or plotting analysis. Excel macros have limited libraries, struggle with large data sets and complex computations and challenging to ensure reporducibitilty.

### Keeping track of your workflow

1. When working with spreadsheets, its quite common that the spreadsheet you end up and what you had in the beginning looks very different. How did you retrace your steps and know why you got there. Or explain 6 months later to your supervisor why you cleaned or filtered the data in such a way. Or produced a graph this way.

There are general guidelines that apply to spreadsheets:
1. create a new duplicate file of the original, and work with the duplicate
2. keep track of your steps to clean and analyze your data, this can be done in a separate text file in the same folder.

Example:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/34556fb4-9ced-490e-8611-e2868ac7430a)

## Structuring data in spreadsheets and in general

1. Keep things tidy
2. Put all variables in columns, the thing your measuring like weight or temperature
3. Put each observation in its own row
4. Don't combime mulitple pieces of information in once cell
5. Leave raw data raw
6. Export the cleaned date ot text-based format like CSV. This ensures anyone can use the data unlike excel that may format the data.

For example:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/290a8012-b228-4b0e-bb5b-a5428165baa7)

The problem is that species and sex are in the same field. So, if they wanted to look at all of one species or look at different weight distributions by sex, it would be hard to do this using this data setup. If instead we put sex and species in different columns, you can see that it would be much easier.

We should have:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/3c81e2cd-1d67-4a4e-9746-72b126e3aff9)

The dates should also be in separate column each, one for day, month and year. But we will discuss that later.

Another example:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/32858fa2-72dc-4ea2-8633-418db9cc4fc5)

the problem is that number of livestock and type of livestock are in the same field. So, if they wanted to look at the average number of livestock owned, or the average number of each type of livestock, it would be hard to do this using this data setup. If instead we put the count of each type of livestock in its own column, this would make analysis much easier.

## Metadata
Recording data about your data (“metadata”) is essential. You may be on intimate terms with your dataset while you are collecting and analysing it, but the chances that you will still remember the exact wording of the question you asked about your informants’ water use (the data recorded in the column water use), for example, are slim.

For your own research: 
The Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) is not just a data documentation initiative; rather, it's an international standard for describing data from the social, behavioral, and economic sciences. The DDI standard provides a framework for documenting and managing data throughout the entire research lifecycle, including conceptualization, collection, processing, distribution, discovery, analysis, and archiving.

Codebook Representation: DDI allows researchers to create codebooks that describe variables, their attributes, and the relationships between them. This is crucial for understanding the structure and content of a dataset.

Example:
Dataset Name: Employee_Survey_Data

1. Variable: Employee_ID
   - Description: Unique identifier for each employee
   - Type: Numeric
   - Range: 1001 to 5000

2. Variable: Age
   - Description: Age of the employee in years
   - Type: Numeric
   - Range: 20 to 65

3. Variable: Gender
   - Description: Gender of the employee
   - Type: Categorical
   - Categories:
     - 1: Male
     - 2: Female


## Beyond Spreadsheets?

Of so we saw some common issues with spreadsheets and way to resolve them. However, the common issues and solutions are all common or native to a Python script. With a Python script you are literally recording each step you need to make to get the original, clean, sort, analyze, and plot it. So if anyone sees your code they can work out exactly what you did to get there. If someone looks at your orignal spreadsheet and then your cleaned and processed spreadsheet they will struggle to understand what you did and reproduce it unless you wrote a long some supporting file documenting the steps.

So I hope that gives you a bit more insight into the uses programming approach.

## Common Errors

1. Multiple tables - confusing just avoid it for users and computer especially
2. Multiple tabs - issues with relating variables to other sheets
3. Not filling in zeros - different to blank, a zero is actual data that was measured
4. Null Values - different to zero, null was not measured and thus should be ignored 
5. Formatting to make data sheet pretty - highlighting and similar - add a new column instead with info
6. Comments in cells - place in separate column
7. Entering more than one piece of information in a cell - only one piece of information per cell
8. Using problematic field names - avoid spaces, numbers, and special characeters
9. Using special characters in data - avoid in your data

Not Filling in Zeros:

Suppose you have a spreadsheet with sales data, and some sales amounts are left blank instead of being filled with zeros.

Null Values:

In the same sales data, some cells are left completely blank, representing null values.

Formatting to Make Data Sheet Pretty:

Users might apply various formatting options such as bold, italics, colors, etc., solely for cosmetic purposes without affecting the underlying data.

Comments in Cells:

Users may add comments to cells to provide additional information.

Entering More Than One Piece of Information in a Cell:

Users may input multiple pieces of information in a single cell.

Using Problematic Field Names:

Users might use spaces or special characters in field names.

Using Special Characters in Data:

Data may contain special characters that can cause issues.
