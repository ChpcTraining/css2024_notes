# What is this for?

Up to this point we have been working with a lot files, namely, Python files and data files. For the most part we have been using the Windows explorer, or the alternative if your on Mac or Linux.

However, an important skill as a researcher these days is to understand how to navigate a terminal. In most cases it involves file management and running scripts.

All apps revolve around terminals or what we call a CLI - command line interface. Anaconda, Python, Slack, Canvas, AWS, all these services give you terminal or CLI access so you have more control over a visual interface like apps. It what makes the digital world go round, so to speak.

Let us first see a few examples. 


# GitBash

Go to windows apps and search for bash, you should see:

If you click on it you will see:

# Linux


# Windows Terminals

It is worthy to note some Windows terminals. The first one is Windows DOS terminal. In your windows apps, search for "dos" and you should see this:

You should see:

And the other more versatile one is the Windows Powershell, which has similar functionality to Linux terminal

There are useful cases where its important to use these but that goes beyond the objectives of this lesson.

# File Management

# Installing Python Libraries

# Connect to GitHub

1. Open up Gitbash and enter the following:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

Then for each input just press "Enter".

Output:

Now you will see the location for public cat

Copy the location for the .pub file, mine is: /c/Users/WDAGUtilityAccount/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Then use it with the "cat" command as follows:

```
cat /c/Users/WDAGUtilityAccount/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Your output should look something similar to this:

Copy the entire output starting with "ssh..."

Now go to your GitHub account.
