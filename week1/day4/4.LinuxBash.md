# What is Linux

Linux is an open-source operating system kernel. An operating system kernel is the core component that manages hardware resources and allows higher-level software to run. Linux is known for its stability, security, and versatility. It forms the basis for many different Linux distributions.

It is widely used for servers, embedded systems, and as an alternative desktop operating system. Different organizations and individuals can build their own Linux distributions based on the Linux kernel, and these distributions vary in terms of included software and user interface.

# What is Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a popular Linux distribution based on Debian. It is designed to be user-friendly and comes with a variety of pre-installed software for ease of use. Ubuntu is known for its regular release cycle and long-term support (LTS) versions, which receive updates and support for an extended period.

Ubuntu provides a graphical user interface (GUI) similar to that of other operating systems like Windows or macOS. It's often recommended for users who are new to Linux because of its user-friendly approach and extensive community support.

# What is a Terminal

A terminal, also known as a command-line interface (CLI) or shell, is a text-based interface in which users interact with the computer by typing commands. It provides a way to navigate the file system, run programs, and perform various tasks using text commands.

The terminal is a powerful tool for users who are comfortable with text commands. It allows for more precise control and scripting capabilities compared to graphical interfaces. In Windows, the equivalent would be the Command Prompt or PowerShell. In Ubuntu it is called a Bash terminal.

# What is Bash

Bash, short for "Bourne Again SHell," is a command processor or shell that provides a command-line interface for interacting with the operating system. It's the default shell for many Linux distributions.

Bash is a powerful scripting language and a command interpreter. It allows users to automate tasks, write scripts, and execute complex commands. Bash is an integral part of the Linux ecosystem, providing a consistent interface for users and scripting.

# Why Learn Bash

Automation: Bash scripts can be written to automate repetitive tasks in data preprocessing, analysis, or simulations.

Remote Servers: Researchers often work with remote servers for high-performance computing or cloud computing. Bash commands are crucial for managing files and executing tasks on these servers.

Version Control: When using version control systems like Git, Bash commands are used to interact with repositories and manage code versions.

Data Exploration: For exploring and manipulating data, researchers might use Bash commands in combination with tools like awk and sed to process and analyze text-based data files efficiently.

In summary, Bash commands are integral for researchers to navigate, organize, and manipulate files and directories efficiently, both locally and on remote servers. These skills contribute to a more streamlined and reproducible research workflow.

**What will we do ?**

Up to this point we have been working with a lot files, namely, Python files and data files. For the most part we have been using the Windows explorer, or the alternative if your on Mac or Linux.

However, an important skill as a researcher these days is to understand how to navigate a terminal. In most cases it involves file management and running scripts.

All apps revolve around terminals or what we call a CLI - command line interface. Anaconda, Python, Slack, Canvas, AWS, all these services give you terminal or CLI access so you have more control over a visual interface like apps. It what makes the digital world go round, so to speak.


# Ubuntu Bash Terminal

In Ubuntu desktop, we can easily edit, copy, rename, move and delete these files. We can also create files and folders. All with a click of a mouse!

Terminals do not have a mouse, so what do you do.

You need to type out the instructions!!! Oh no more typing :(  ... yes more typing. But just like we tried to explain with writing Python scripts, we are recording the steps taken to read in the data, filter, sort and plot it. In excel, you don't track all these steps. Therefore it is difficult to rememeber what you did 6 months later if you suddenly want to change something.

Now let us assume we have 100s of files, and you want to rename them? Are you going to click on each file in windows and rename it...you might of had to do this or something similar. Just like in Python where we try to automate the boring and mundane tasks, using a Bash terminal we can automate file management.

There are many things we can do with a bash terminal, however we will just focus on file management for now.

Let us go to dara project we created:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b12e58dd-beb8-4694-8cc3-141edbda8d83)

Now in this same folder, right-click a folder and you get many options:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d2c58b9-dd6d-4747-9b7a-effc33c1a158)

Now click on an open area and right-click and click on Open in Terminal:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2b3988f-c07a-4ed7-b54a-0a2c1f181c10)


The terminal pops up and shows the following text prompt:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d02560fc-7ded-4de2-b094-4ae6e2f7b006)

```
(base) rigel@rigel-Latitude-E6520:~/Documents/dara2024$ 
```

It is not necessary to know what this all means but in summary the prompt is telling you that you are in the base conda environment, logged in as user "rigel" on machine "rigel-Latitude-E6520" and your current working directory is "~/Documents/dara2024." The "$" indicates that you are logged into a Unix-like shell (e.g., Bash) as a regular, non-root user and it is ready to accept commands.

The main part of the prompt to take note of is your working directory.

Let us explore this directory.

**Basics Terminal Functions**

Just like in Python we had interactive console which we used to run a few lines of code, add numbers and print some text to the screen. Well we can do the same in a Bash terminal too. Instead of the `print()` function in Python we use `echo`. Input the following:

```
$ echo "hello world"
hello world
```

To do basic arithmetic you will also use the `echo` command like this:

```
$ echo $((5+5))
10
```

When you enclose an arithmetic expression within $(()), the shell evaluates the expression and substitutes the result, otherwise it would treat as a string rather. There are other ways to do arithmetic.

You can also store variables and create a simple equation:

```
$ x=5

$ y=10

$ sum=$((x+y))

$ echo "The sum is: $sum"
The sum is: 15
```

>_Note that `x = 10` will give you an error, bash is sensitive to spaces_

**Directories**

Getting info about the current working directory:

1. `pwd` (print current working directory)

```
$ pwd
/home/rigel/Documents/dara2024
```

>_Type this command always to check where you are...so you know where you are going_

**Explore directories**

Input the following in the terminal to list files and folders:

1. `ls` (list contents of current directory)

```
$ ls
app.py            day2.py               plot2.html       summary_day2.py
country_data.csv  day2_storing_data.py  plot.html
data_01           day3_numpy.py         radio_freq.py
data_02           day3.py               summary_day1.py
```

2. `ls -lh`  (list contents of current directory, -lh are extra parameters to give details for each file and make it human readable)

```
$ ls -lh
total 7.1M
-rwxrwxr-x 1 rigel rigel 1.7K Oct 22 10:56 app.py
-rw-rw-r-- 1 rigel rigel  181 Oct 21 12:31 country_data.csv
drwxrwxr-x 3 rigel rigel 4.0K Oct 21 12:34 data_01
drwxrwxr-x 3 rigel rigel 4.0K Oct 23 08:53 data_02
-rwxrwxr-x 1 rigel rigel 1.6K Oct 22 11:13 day2.py
-rwxrwxr-x 1 rigel rigel 1.9K Oct 23 08:31 day2_storing_data.py
-rwxrwxr-x 1 rigel rigel  998 Oct 24 14:11 day3_numpy.py
-rwxrwxr-x 1 rigel rigel  884 Oct 23 11:27 day3.py
-rw-rw-r-- 1 rigel rigel 3.6M Oct 23 11:27 plot2.html
-rw-rw-r-- 1 rigel rigel 3.6M Oct 23 11:28 plot.html
-rwxrwxr-x 1 rigel rigel  981 Oct 23 10:32 radio_freq.py
-rwxrwxr-x 1 rigel rigel  416 Oct 22 10:43 summary_day1.py
-rwxrwxr-x 1 rigel rigel  12K Oct 23 11:11 summary_day2.py
```

> A useful command is `clear` which clears the terminal

3. `ls -lR` (list contents of current directory, -lR are extra parameters to give details for each file sub folders)

4. To see contents of a specific folder: `ls data_01/`

```
$ ls data_01/
country_data.csv  diab_data.csv     insurance_data.csv
data_01           housing_data.csv  iris.csv
```

>_Note a folder is always followed by a forward slash: /

5. `ls ..` (see contents of one directory up)

6. `ls ../../` (see contents of two directories up)

7. `ls ../dara_2024/` (see contents of one directory up and folder: dara_2024)

>_Anytime you see a backslash at the end of a text it refers to a folder: `dara_2024/`_

Note, when we are exploring other directories with `ls` we are using relative paths compared to our 
current working directory, just like we did in Python with read_csv. We can also use absolute paths.

**Moving Around**

Let us move to the directory: data_01/.

First where are we, check with `pwd`:

Where do we need to go: `data_01/`:

So we use the command `cd` or change directory to move to that directory:

```
$ cd data_01/
```

Then you will see the prompt will also that that directory.

And to double check use `pwd` to know where you are.

Check the contents of the folder with `ls`.

> Useful tip: use the up and down arrow keys to see your previous commands, or type `history` to see all your commands


**Creating folders & files**

Let us create a new folder called `temp` with `mkdir` and list the contents of the directory:

```
$ mkdir temp
```

Let us change directories to `temp`:

```
$ cd temp
```

Let us create a file called `notes.txt` with `touch`:

```
$ touch notes.txt
$ ls
notes.txt
```

> Usefil tip: when typing out a name of a file or folder you can use the `Tab` key to autocomplete

**Copy, rename, move, & delete files**

Let us make another copy of `notes.txt` with `cp` command:

```
$ cp notes.txt notes2.txt
$ ls
notes.txt  notes2.txt
```

Let us rename `notes.txt` to `notes1.txt` with the `mv` command:

```
$ mv notes.txt notes1.txt
$ ls
notes1.txt  notes2.txt
```

Besides renaming files with `mv` you can also move it files. Let us move `notes2.txt` one folder up:

```
$ mv notes2.txt ../
$ ls
notes1.txt
```

We can delete a file with the `rm` command, let us delete notes1.txt:

```
$ rm notes1.txt
$ ls
```

>_We can do the same operations for copy `cp` and remove for `rm` folders, however in each case they need an extra parameter added to indicate this is a recursive operation. As it won't just copy the folder but each of the files inside it, and in the same removing files inside folders.

**Moving Multiple Files**

Now what if you want to move multiple files. Let us say we want to move all the python files to a new folder called py_folder. We first need create that folder and move it using the following:

```
mkdir py_folder
mv *.py pyfolder
```

```
$ ls -l py_folder/
total 8
-rw-r--r-- 1 CSIR+BBarsch 4096    0 Jan 30 09:49 day2_file.py
-rw-r--r-- 1 CSIR+BBarsch 4096 3987 Jan 30 15:40 day2_file2.py
-rw-r--r-- 1 CSIR+BBarsch 4096  813 Jan 30 21:52 plots.py
```

>_How did we do that, we did it with the * wildcard. It allows us to search for a pattern for any filename that just ends with .py, it will move it. You can also specificy certain characters as well if you are searching for certain filenames.

### More on WildCards

In Bash, the `?` and `*` characters are wildcards used to match filenames:

- `*` matches zero or more characters.
- `?` matches exactly one character.

Example:

Let us say you have the following files in a directory:

```
cat.txt, cart.txt, cute.txt, cot.txt, coat.txt
```

If you do `ls c?t.txt`, then `?` must match match exactly one character between c and t.

The results must be: cat.txt, cot.txt.


Now, if we do `ls c*e.txt`, `*` matches any number of characters between c and e.

The result is only cute.txt.


**Interacting with Files**

Let us have a look at the iris.csv data using the `cat` command:

```
$ cat iris.csv
,sepal_length,sepal_width,petal_length,petal_width,class,
100,6.3,3.3,6.0,2.5,virginica,39.69,39.69
101,5.8,2.7,5.1,1.9,virginica,33.64,33.64
102,7.1,3.0,5.9,2.1,virginica,50.41,50.41
103,6.3,2.9,5.6,1.8,virginica,39.69,39.69
104,6.5,3.0,5.8,2.2,virginica,42.25,42.25
105,7.6,3.0,6.6,2.1,virginica,57.76,57.76
107,7.3,2.9,6.3,1.8,virginica,53.29,53.29
108,6.7,2.5,5.8,1.8,virginica,44.89,44.89
109,7.2,3.6,6.1,2.5,virginica,51.84,51.84
110,6.5,3.2,5.1,2.0,virginica,42.25,42.25
```


If it is very large file with 1000s of lines you can use `head` to see the first 10 lines, and `tail` to see the last 10 lines of a file.

We can also redirect content to a file using the append ">>" operater. This is useful for logging information:

```
echo "2024-02-01,80" >> logfile.txt
```

The file will be created if it did not exist. If there are cases where we want to redirect outputs to a new file each time we can use the ">" redirect operator. 

Now what happens if you want to edit a file itself. We can use a built in terminal editor called Nano to do that. Input the following:

```
nano notes2.txt
```

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/5e460a0a-bdc7-4dc2-92dc-5fb77ed9f8e5)

Just like any word or notepad text editor we can add the following text:

```
hello world
Linux was invented in 1991 by Linus Torvalds
Linux is written mostly in the C programming language
```

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/3cc04830-b7a0-4446-96ba-c600b67d705b)


We also have several options at the bottom of the screen to Get Help, Exit, and many more. The ^ refers to the Ctrl key on your keyboard. To save the changes we made to the file we need to press Ctrl key and the x key on your keyboard:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/a98c90ea-2d94-4d49-bd53-5c32417291ef)

When you do that the bottom of the screen will change to this:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/22ce1ff9-320f-416a-8916-952af05b701f)

To save changes press the y key or n to discard the changes. Press the y key to save changes and you will see the following:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/2e7b2a25-7c57-4f57-9d41-d35deffb9021)

Now just press the Enter key and you will exit the text editor and back to your terminal.

**Find & Search**

There are cases where you may want to find files themselves. For example all files that start with day in it:

```
$ find -name "day*"
./day2.py
./day2_storing_data.py
./day3_numpy.py
./day3.py
```

>_Now there may be cases where you want to search for specific words in files, and you can use "grep" for that. For example if we want to find all rows that have the word "virginica" in it we can do it as follows:

```
$ grep -n "virginica" *.csv
101:6.3,3.3,6.0,2.5,virginica
102:5.8,2.7,5.1,1.9,virginica
103:7.1,3.0,5.9,2.1,virginica

```

Again using the * wildcard to search through all csv files.

# Summary

There are many different uses for a bash terminal, some might not be relevant to you know but it is an essential skill. In summary, Bash commands are integral for researchers to navigate, organize, and manipulate files and directories efficiently, both locally and on remote servers. These skills contribute to a more streamlined and reproducible research workflow.

There is a still a lot of content we did not cover. Like how to connect to remote servers and copy from them. Writing bash script files to automate processes and much more! However, this is sufficient as introduction to bash terminals.
