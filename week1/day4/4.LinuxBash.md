# What is this for?

Up to this point we have been working with a lot files, namely, Python files and data files. For the most part we have been using the Windows explorer, or the alternative if your on Mac or Linux.

However, an important skill as a researcher these days is to understand how to navigate a terminal. In most cases it involves file management and running scripts.

Let us first see a few examples. 


# GitBash

Go to windows apps and search for bash, you should see:

There are useful cases where its important to use these but that goes beyond the objectives of this lesson.
