# What is Linux

Linux is an open-source operating system kernel. An operating system kernel is the core component that manages hardware resources and allows higher-level software to run. Linux is known for its stability, security, and versatility. It forms the basis for many different Linux distributions.

It is widely used for servers, embedded systems, and as an alternative desktop operating system. Different organizations and individuals can build their own Linux distributions based on the Linux kernel, and these distributions vary in terms of included software and user interface.

# What is Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a popular Linux distribution based on Debian. It is designed to be user-friendly and comes with a variety of pre-installed software for ease of use. Ubuntu is known for its regular release cycle and long-term support (LTS) versions, which receive updates and support for an extended period.

Ubuntu provides a graphical user interface (GUI) similar to that of other operating systems like Windows or macOS. It's often recommended for users who are new to Linux because of its user-friendly approach and extensive community support.

# What is a Terminal

A terminal, also known as a command-line interface (CLI) or shell, is a text-based interface in which users interact with the computer by typing commands. It provides a way to navigate the file system, run programs, and perform various tasks using text commands.

The terminal is a powerful tool for users who are comfortable with text commands. It allows for more precise control and scripting capabilities compared to graphical interfaces. In Windows, the equivalent would be the Command Prompt or PowerShell. In Ubuntu it is called a Bash terminal.

# What is Bash

Bash, short for "Bourne Again SHell," is a command processor or shell that provides a command-line interface for interacting with the operating system. It's the default shell for many Linux distributions.

Bash is a powerful scripting language and a command interpreter. It allows users to automate tasks, write scripts, and execute complex commands. Bash is an integral part of the Linux ecosystem, providing a consistent interface for users and scripting.

# Why Learn Bash

Automation: Bash scripts can be written to automate repetitive tasks in data preprocessing, analysis, or simulations.

Remote Servers: Researchers often work with remote servers for high-performance computing or cloud computing. Bash commands are crucial for managing files and executing tasks on these servers.

Version Control: When using version control systems like Git, Bash commands are used to interact with repositories and manage code versions.

Data Exploration: For exploring and manipulating data, researchers might use Bash commands in combination with tools like awk and sed to process and analyze text-based data files efficiently.

In summary, Bash commands are integral for researchers to navigate, organize, and manipulate files and directories efficiently, both locally and on remote servers. These skills contribute to a more streamlined and reproducible research workflow.


Up to this point we have been working with a lot files, namely, Python files and data files. For the most part we have been using the Windows explorer, or the alternative if your on Mac or Linux.

However, an important skill as a researcher these days is to understand how to navigate a terminal. In most cases it involves file management and running scripts.

All apps revolve around terminals or what we call a CLI - command line interface. Anaconda, Python, Slack, Canvas, AWS, all these services give you terminal or CLI access so you have more control over a visual interface like apps. It what makes the digital world go round, so to speak.

Let us first see a few examples. 


# GitBash

Go to windows apps and search for bash, you should see:

If you click on it you will see:

# Linux


# Windows Terminals

It is worthy to note some Windows terminals. The first one is Windows DOS terminal. In your windows apps, search for "dos" and you should see this:

You should see:

And the other more versatile one is the Windows Powershell, which has similar functionality to Linux terminal

There are useful cases where its important to use these but that goes beyond the objectives of this lesson.

Now to work with it on our local laptop we use the term "clone" to download it. Go ahead and "clone" one of your repositories:

---

---

Now let us make a simple change to one of the files to see how this works, click on "Show in Explorer":

---

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/f59d8d14-6173-4a44-93db-c42474b981f9)

I will change my README.md file in notepad by just adding an extra line and saving it:

---

---

Close the file and go back to GitHub Desktop. You will see it has recorded the change I made to my file:

---

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/7c1e8bab-d94a-41c0-9c37-d471e8c0278b)

---

But that is a local change, I want to send that same change to GitHub Cloud. 

So I first click on "Commit to main":

---

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/8e27c1ee-d4c7-4b5f-a449-b72aa79808f6)

---

Now if you go to GitHub cloud, let us see if we see that same change now:

>This is basic work flow for using GitHub. I have left out many things for the simple reason to show you how it works as its an essential tool.
>There are many tutorials and lessons online that are more detailed.
