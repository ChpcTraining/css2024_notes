# What is this for?

Up to this point we have been working with a lot files, namely, Python files and data files. For the most part we have been using the Windows explorer, or the alternative if your on Mac or Linux.

However, an important skill as a researcher these days is to understand how to navigate a terminal. In most cases it involves file management and running scripts.

All apps revolve around terminals or what we call a CLI - command line interface. Anaconda, Python, Slack, Canvas, AWS, all these services give you terminal or CLI access so you have more control over a visual interface like apps. It what makes the digital world go round, so to speak.

Let us first see a few examples. 


# GitBash

Go to windows apps and search for bash, you should see:

If you click on it you will see:

# Linux


# Windows Terminals

It is worthy to note some Windows terminals. The first one is Windows DOS terminal. In your windows apps, search for "dos" and you should see this:

You should see:

And the other more versatile one is the Windows Powershell, which has similar functionality to Linux terminal

There are useful cases where its important to use these but that goes beyond the objectives of this lesson.

# File Management

# Installing Python Libraries

# Connect to GitHub

Download and install GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/

Then you will see GitHub Desktop window pop up showing your respositories online:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/0ad73a2b-6499-4257-9e6a-e0cc6beb5245)

Now to work with it on our local laptop we use the term "clone" to download it. Go ahead and "clone" one of your repositories:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/44f7575a-0bcf-4f1b-b778-9fa285418112)

Choose where you want to clone it to, then click on "Clone":

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/5815ddfe-96ca-4c24-bb70-fb6b31dc04bd)

Here it is busy cloning or downloading it to your local machine:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/3ba88016-c01d-4949-8559-9c92a4515695)

Now let us make a simple change to one of the files to see how this works, click on "Show in Explorer":

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/825a6eda-4f09-429a-ad6b-d1108c4214cb)

I will change my README.md file in notepad by just adding an extra line and saving it:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/7903e169-fe7a-48ba-af8c-558bad81b35f)

Close the file and go back to GitHub Desktop. You will see it has recorded the change I made to my file:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/7c1e8bab-d94a-41c0-9c37-d471e8c0278b)

But that is a local change, I want to send that same change to GitHub Cloud. 

So I first click on "Commit to main":

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/8e27c1ee-d4c7-4b5f-a449-b72aa79808f6)

Then click on "Push origin":

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/4dbbad43-52ab-4fd1-b7c3-1a1faa1779c3)

Then everything will be clear again on GitHub Desktop:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/727e338b-40a0-488c-975d-60b2e7471ef1)

Now if you go to GitHub cloud, let us see if we see that same change now:

>This is basic work flow for using GitHub. I have left out many things for the simple reason to show you how it works as its an essential tool.
>There are many tutorials and lessons online that are more detailed.
