# What is Linux

Linux is an open-source operating system kernel. An operating system kernel is the core component that manages hardware resources and allows higher-level software to run. Linux is known for its stability, security, and versatility. It forms the basis for many different Linux distributions.

It is widely used for servers, embedded systems, and as an alternative desktop operating system. Different organizations and individuals can build their own Linux distributions based on the Linux kernel, and these distributions vary in terms of included software and user interface.

# What is Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a popular Linux distribution based on Debian. It is designed to be user-friendly and comes with a variety of pre-installed software for ease of use. Ubuntu is known for its regular release cycle and long-term support (LTS) versions, which receive updates and support for an extended period.

Ubuntu provides a graphical user interface (GUI) similar to that of other operating systems like Windows or macOS. It's often recommended for users who are new to Linux because of its user-friendly approach and extensive community support.

# What is a Terminal

A terminal, also known as a command-line interface (CLI) or shell, is a text-based interface in which users interact with the computer by typing commands. It provides a way to navigate the file system, run programs, and perform various tasks using text commands.

The terminal is a powerful tool for users who are comfortable with text commands. It allows for more precise control and scripting capabilities compared to graphical interfaces. In Windows, the equivalent would be the Command Prompt or PowerShell. In Ubuntu it is called a Bash terminal.

# What is Bash

Bash, short for "Bourne Again SHell," is a command processor or shell that provides a command-line interface for interacting with the operating system. It's the default shell for many Linux distributions.

Bash is a powerful scripting language and a command interpreter. It allows users to automate tasks, write scripts, and execute complex commands. Bash is an integral part of the Linux ecosystem, providing a consistent interface for users and scripting.

# Why Learn Bash

Automation: Bash scripts can be written to automate repetitive tasks in data preprocessing, analysis, or simulations.

Remote Servers: Researchers often work with remote servers for high-performance computing or cloud computing. Bash commands are crucial for managing files and executing tasks on these servers.

Version Control: When using version control systems like Git, Bash commands are used to interact with repositories and manage code versions.

Data Exploration: For exploring and manipulating data, researchers might use Bash commands in combination with tools like awk and sed to process and analyze text-based data files efficiently.

In summary, Bash commands are integral for researchers to navigate, organize, and manipulate files and directories efficiently, both locally and on remote servers. These skills contribute to a more streamlined and reproducible research workflow.

**What will we do ?**

Up to this point we have been working with a lot files, namely, Python files and data files. For the most part we have been using the Windows explorer, or the alternative if your on Mac or Linux.

However, an important skill as a researcher these days is to understand how to navigate a terminal. In most cases it involves file management and running scripts.

All apps revolve around terminals or what we call a CLI - command line interface. Anaconda, Python, Slack, Canvas, AWS, all these services give you terminal or CLI access so you have more control over a visual interface like apps. It what makes the digital world go round, so to speak.


# GitBash

In windows, we can easily edit, copy, rename, move and delete these files. We can also create files and folders. All with a click of a mouse!

Terminals do not have a mouse, so what do you do.

You need to type out the instructions!!! Oh no more typing :(  ... yes more typing. But just like we tried to explain with writing Python scripts, we are recording the steps taken to read in the data, filter, sort and plot it. In excel, you don't track all these steps. Therefore it is difficult to rememeber what you did 6 months later if you suddenly want to change something.

Now let us assume we have 100s of files, and you want to rename them? Are you going to click on each file in windows and rename it...you might of had to do this or something similar. Just like in Python where we try to automate the boring and mundane tasks, using a Bash terminal we can automate file management.

There are many things we can do with a bash terminal, however we will just focus on file management for now.

Let us go to yesterdays project we created with Spyder:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/81565516-9ca0-4044-9d7c-f793bf67b5bf)

Now in this same folder, right-click on an empty space and click on "Git-bash" as one of the options:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/b3b8a693-ee42-49cf-a687-f1af358aeabe)

The Git-bash terminal will now open:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/f7263e3b-3b7f-453e-a10f-62ad70ea101a)

The terminal pops up and shows the following text prompt:

```
(base)
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day03
$
```

It is not necessary to know what this all means but in summary the prompt is telling you that you are in the base conda environment, logged in as user "CSIR+BBarsch" on machine "BBARSCH-NB1" using the MINGW64 shell, and your current working directory is "css2024_day03." The shell is ready to accept commands (indicated by the $ symbol).

The main part of the prompt to take not of is this part: `~/css2024_day03` - This again represents the current working directory. In this example, it's the "css2024_day03" directory located in the user's home directory (~ represents the home directory).

Let us explore this directory.

**Basics Terminal Functions**

Just like in Python we had interactive console which we used to run a few lines of code, add numbers and print some text to the screen. Well we can do the same in a Bash terminal too. Instead of the `print()` function in Python we use `echo`. Input the following:

```
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day03
$ echo "hello world"
hello world
```

To do basic arithmetic you will also use the `echo` command like this:

```
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day03
$ echo $((5+5))
10
```

When you enclose an arithmetic expression within $(()), the shell evaluates the expression and substitutes the result, otherwise it would treat as a string rather. There are other ways to do arithmetic.

You can also store variables and create a simple equation:

```
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day03
$ x=5
(base)
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day03
$ y=10
(base)
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day03
$ sum=$((x+y))
(base)
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day03
$ echo "The sum is: $sum"
The sum is: 15
```

>_Note that `x = 10` will give you an error, bash is sensitive to spaces_

**Directories**

Getting info about the current working directory others around it:

1. pwd (print current working directory)

```
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day03
$ pwd
/c/Users/BBarsch.CSIR/css2024_day03

```
>_Type this command always to check where you are...so you know where you are going_

**Explore directories**

Input the following in the terminal to list files and folders:

1. ls (list contents of current directory)

```
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day03
$ ls
chat_files/      iris_plot.py

eda01_plotly.py  your_report.html
```

2. ls -lh  (list contents of current directory, -lh are extra parameters to give details for each file and make it human readable)

```
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day03

6. ls ../../

```
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day03
$ ls ../../

```

7. ls ../css2024_day02/

```
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day03
$ ls ../css2024_day02/
chat_files/  data_02/  day2.xlsx  day2_file.py  day2_file2.py  output/  plot.html  plots.py  pulsar.csv  your_report.html
```

>_Anytime you see a backslash at the end of a text it refers to a folder: `css2024_day02/`_

Note, when we are exploring other directories with `ls` we are using relative paths compared to our 
current working directory, just like we did in Python with read_csv. We can also use absolute paths like:

```
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day02/temp
$ ls /c/Users/BBarsch.CSIR/css2024_day03
chat_files/  data_plot.py  eda01_plotly.py  pandas_profiling_iris.py  time_series_plot.py
csd_data.py  eda01.py      iris_plot.py     plot.html                 your_report.html

```

**Moving Around**

Let us move to the directory: css2024_day02/.

First where are we, check with `pwd`:

```
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day03
$ pwd
/c/Users/BBarsch.CSIR/css2024_day03
```

Where do we need to go: `../css2024_day02/` this means it is one folder up.

So we use the command `cd` or change directory to move to that directory:

```
$ cd ../css2024_day02/
```

Then you will see the prompt shows `css2024_day02` now:

```
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day02
$ 
```

And to double check use `pwd`:

```
$ pwd
/c/Users/BBarsch.CSIR/css2024_day02
```

Check the contents of the folder:

```
$ ls
chat_files/  data_02/  day2.xlsx  day2_file.py  day2_file2.py  output/  plot.html  plots.py  pulsar.csv  your_report.html
```

**Creating folders & files**

Let us create a new folder called `temp` with `mkdir` and list the contents of the directory:

```
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day02
$ mkdir temp
(base)
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day02
$ ls
chat_files/  data_02/  day2.xlsx  day2_file.py  day2_file2.py  output/  plot.html  plots.py  pulsar.csv  temp/  your_report.html
(base)
```

Let us change directories to `temp`:

```
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day02
$ cd temp
(base)
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day02/temp
```

Let us create a file called `notes.txt` with `touch`:

```
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day02/temp
$ touch notes.txt
(base)
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day02/temp
$ ls
notes.txt
```

What does this look now in windows explorer:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/3a5e346c-baf9-49d5-bc65-d3623076c97f)

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/d26ca92f-dbea-4d8c-8189-ecc7b1a22f9d)

How do we go to the home directory!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, let us say you start Git-bash from windows app!!!!!!!!!!!!

**Copy, rename, move, & delete files**

Let us make another copy of `notes.txt` with `cp` command:

```
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day02/temp
$ cp notes.txt notes2.txt
(base)
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day02/temp
$ ls
notes.txt  notes2.txt
```

Let us rename `notes.txt` to `notes1.txt` with the `mv` command:

```
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day02/temp
$ mv notes.txt notes1.txt
(base)
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day02/temp
$ ls
notes1.txt  notes2.txt
```

The besides renaming files with `mv` you can also move it files. Let us move `notes2.txt` one folder up:

```
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day02/temp
$ mv notes2.txt ../
(base)
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day02/temp
$ ls
notes1.txt
(base)
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day02/temp
$ ls ../
chat_files/  data_02/  day2.xlsx  day2_file.py  day2_file2.py  notes2.txt  output/  plot.html  plots.py  pulsar.csv  temp/  your_report.html
(base)
```

We can delete a file with the `rm` command, let us delete notes1.txt:

```
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day02/temp
$ rm notes1.txt
(base)
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day02/temp
$ ls
```

We can do the same operations for copy `cp` and remove for `rm` folders, however in each case they need an extra parameter added to indicate this is a recursive operation. As it won't just copy the folder but each of the files inside it, and in the same removing files inside folders.

```
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day02
$ cp -r temp temp2
(base)
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day02
$ ls
chat_files/  day2.xlsx     day2_file2.py  output/    plots.py    temp/   your_report.html
data_02/     day2_file.py  notes2.txt     plot.html  pulsar.csv  temp2/
```

```
CSIR+BBarsch@BBARSCH-NB1 MINGW64 ~/css2024_day02
$ rm -r temp2/
```

# Linux


# Windows Terminals

It is worthy to note some Windows terminals. The first one is Windows DOS terminal. In your windows apps, search for "dos" and you should see this:
