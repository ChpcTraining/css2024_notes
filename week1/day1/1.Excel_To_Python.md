# Excel to Python

"Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, itâ€™s bad." - Cory House

Before we can transition from excel to Python we have to learn some more fundamentals about Python

## 1. Python Scripts

We are going to write a recipe for instructions in Python, this type of file is known as a Python script.

The first thing we will do is to create a Project directory to keep all our files:

Choose a name and location:

You will see now the folder location and your files in the current folder, which only has the default project file `.spyproject...`.

On the left-hand side of your screen you will see your text editor. Click on File -> New File:

It will now create a temporary file called "untitled0.py", if you save it will ask you for a name like pyfile01.py

It will be saved in your project:

And now listed as well here on the right-hand side:

Now in the text editor input `print("My First Python File")`:

Save it "Ctrl+S" and then press the green trianle Run button or press "F5" to run the script. 
A window may popup suggesting to "Execute in current console", just say Yes.

You will see it outputs the text to the console. This is the basic process to code and run the file. Write some text or
code in the text editor section, run it, and see the output in the console...thats it.

A good practice with coding is to add comments to your file so you know what have done. To create a comment you type the # hash symbol before anything, then you can add any text after that. Python will interpret that as a comment and not execute it. Input the following under your print() function in the file: 

`# This is my first comment`

Run the file, do you see any change?

## 2. Variables
