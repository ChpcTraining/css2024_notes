# Excel to Python

"Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad." - Cory House

Before we can transition from excel to Python we have to learn some more fundamentals about Python

## 1. Python Scripts

We are going to write a recipe for instructions in Python, this type of file is known as a Python script.

The first thing we will do is to create a Project directory to keep all our files:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/e6a154f7-bac4-408d-aa24-980f63283ddf)

Choose a name and location:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/015f9a79-84f0-43b4-9594-b9e10e11d427)

You will see now the folder location and your files in the current folder, which only has the default project file `.spyproject...`.

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/3a8765cc-39aa-4056-855b-634a0d694f7a)

On the left-hand side of your screen you will see your text editor. Click on File -> New File:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/c761cce8-5150-4b56-8c04-4782e6a54f4e)

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/0990d47d-d318-4d1e-a033-9f13df901716)

It will now create a temporary file called "untitled0.py", if you save it will ask you for a name like pyfile01.py

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/4bdd80a5-7a79-453c-bede-42d19497fd86)

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/f18b3b8a-3a10-482f-800d-577ce318c8ff)

It will be saved in your project:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/e4989057-f5c3-4b13-9875-13f6e5444af4)

And now listed as well here on the right-hand side:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/ea98c5e1-3afc-476e-9feb-eb134a2c7472)

Now in the text editor input `print("My First Python File")`:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/567f05d8-9ac8-475b-affd-4735352fb3f3)


Save it "Ctrl+S" and then press the green trianle Run button or press "F5" to run the script. 
A window may popup suggesting to "Execute in current console", just say Yes.

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/c4003d2d-d592-4a57-bc7f-9cea609c631a)

You will see it outputs the text to the console. This is the basic process to code and run the file. Write some text or
code in the text editor section, run it, and see the output in the console...thats it.

A good practice with coding is to add comments to your file so you know what have done. To create a comment you type the # hash symbol before anything, then you can add any text after that. Python will interpret that as a comment and not execute it. Input the following under your print() function in the file: 

`# This is my first comment`

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/6fae0ba1-5ede-4ec4-adaf-e5ae6db5ef94)

Run the file, do you see any change?

For all the next few lessons, try out the examples by putting it into your python file and running it.

## 2. Variables

### Variable Naming

It is recommended that when naming variables you follow the following rules:

- A variable can have a short name like x or y or more descriptive ones like age, my_age, country_list.
- A variable must start with a letter or underscore
- A variable cannot start with a number
- A variable can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores
- A variable name is case-sensitive: age, Age, and AGE are all different variable names

Have a look at the examples below:

```
# Valid Names
x = 50
age = 50
_age = 50
my_age = 50
mYagE = 50
my_age_2 = 50
```

```
# Invalid names
2age = 50
my age = 50
my-age = 50
```

Try them out in the console and see what happens...

### Variable Types

In the previous we lesson we did a few examples with variables. We learnt about two types of variables which is an integer and a string. And integer (or int) refers to whole numbers that are either positive or negative. For example 5, 2021, or -256. A string refers to any text. That can be a single character, word, or groups of words.

There is one more type that we will use often which is a float or a variable number that has decimals. The float or floating point number is any decimal number like 0.5, -34.56, and 3.1451245.

We can determine what types of variables we have using the built-in type function. Let us first check what type of variable x is by running the code below:

```
# Variables

# An integer:
x = 40
print(x)
print(type(x))

# A float:
x = 40.2
print(x)
print(type(x))

# String examples:
x = "P"
print(x)
print(type(x))

x = "Python"
print(x)
print(type(x))

x = "Python course"
print(x)
print(type(x))
```

You get back <class 'int'> which tells us this variable is an integer, <class 'float'> for the number that has decimals and then <class 'str'> for the variables that had text.

### String Indexing

Understanding strings and how to manipulate them is a crucial part to understanding Python programming. There are a lot of core principles that lead off from understanding and manipulating strings. There are also a lot of similarities between strings and lists! Lets first look at a few important concepts. Strings in Python are either surrounded by single quotation marks or double quotation marks. And as we saw before, we can assign it to a variable:

```
string_one = "Python Course"
print(string_one)
string_two = '1000'
print(string_two)
```

Run the code to see the output you get.

In other programming languages single characters like “b“ or “4“ are a unique data type on its own and often referred to as a char or character data type. In Python, it is still considered a string just of length 1. And just like we accessed items in a list through their index positions, we can also access single or multiple characters of a string using their associated index:

```
print(string_two[0])
print(string_one[:])
print(string_one[0:4])
print(string_one[-1])
```

Run the code to see the output you get.

This should all be familiar to you as you have seen it with lists. The second last command we have seen in lists where we only want a certain range of the string, this is known as string slicing. The only new way of accessing strings, which applies to lists too, is the last command where we used [-1]. This is a cool feature with Python where [-1] allows you to access the very last value of the string. One last feature is that to join or concatenate more than one strings. And we do this quite simply:

```
string_three = string_one + string_two
print(string_three)

string_three = string_one + " " + string_two
print(string_three)
print(len(string_three))
```

We can also use the function len() to get the length of a string as well as seen above.

Run the code to see the output you get.

### String Modifying

Here are a few examples of how we can modify strings and replace letters or numbers within them:

```
mystring = 'PyThoN'

# we can make all letters lower case:
print(mystring.lower())

# we can make all letters upper case:
print(mystring.upper())

# replace a string with another:
print(mystring.replace('P','Q'))
```

Run the code to see the output you get.

## 3. Storing Data

Now let us look at our excel dataset again:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/e6acb982-e76f-4bc7-9c3f-283895f9bb2d)

The first thing we wanted to do was get some statistics on the age column, like the minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation metrics.

Now there are two ways of doing this. The better approach is just to import this excel file into Python and then find the metrics. The second way and longer way is to input the data ourselves. We will be doing the latter in order to understand the Python principles of variables and data types.

Just like in excel where we are storing numbers in cells we can also store numbers in Python as variables. So for example we have at cell B2 is equal to 30, cell B3 is equal to 40, and so on. Run the code below:

```
# Storing Data
B1 = 30
B2 = 40
B3 = 30
B4 = 49

print(B1)
print(B2)
```

Try storing the rest of the variables that we got from the excel dataset in column B and print them out too.

Now to store each value in a separate variable is a tedious process especially if we want to get some statistics from it. So let us rather use a variable that can store multiple values. There are many of these in Python, for now we are going to use one called a list. And a list is defined by square [] brackets with the values inside the square brackets separated by commas. We can also give a list a unique name. Let us call it age to match the excel column B dataset and do it as follows:

```
# Using Lists
age = [30,40,30,49,22,35,22,46,29,25,39]
print(age)

# Lists indexes start at 0 which has the value of 30
print(age[0])
print(age[1])
print(age[10])

# This will give an error as there is no value at index 11
print(age[11])
```

This looks a lot better. We can store all those values of age in a list data type called age:

```
age = [30,40,30,49,22,35,22,46,29,25,39]
```

Take note that to access any of the values all we need to do is use age[index]. Where index refers to the location in the list datatype. Note, the first value is stored at index 0 not 1. The second value is stored at index 1 and so on. The last value is stored at index 10:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/2400e5c5-32ed-4b4b-9741-79ab60ad5351)

If you try to access the index at 11 you will get the error list index out of range. See the excel data set again and look at column A called index to see how the values are stored.

Now we use some built in Python functions to get the same statistics we got in excel as shown below. Run the code below:

```
# Basic Stats
age = [30,40,30,49,22,35,22,46,29,25,39]

print(min(age))
print(max(age))
print(len(age))
print(sum(age))
average = sum(age)/len(age)
print(average)
```

So the cool thing is we can use the built in functions min, max, len, and sum to get the minimum and maximum number, the length of the list, and the sum of all the numbers. Thereafter, we can easily get the average. We will look at more of a manual approach later instead of using these functions. However, you will need to learn a little more do that. We will look at getting standard deviation a little later as well.

Let us now record all the information in other columns in lists too. So in the excel data set we have column C that holds Gender values for M (male) and F (female). Like before we can store the variables individually based on the cells. Run the code below:


```
# Storing Text
C2 = M
C3 = M
C4 = F
```

But wait! Its giving us an error name 'M' is not defined Why is that? Any letters, words, group of words fall under the category of a string data type. Therefore we need to add " to the beginning and end. Run the code below:

```
C2 = "M"
C3 = "M"
C4 = "F"
print(C2)
print(C3)
print(C4)
```

Again this is a tedious task so let us create a list for gender:

```
# gender list
gender = ["M","M","F","M","F","F","F","M","M","F","M"]
```

Run the code below:

```
gender = ["M","M","F","M","F","F","F","M","M","F","M"]
print(gender[0])
print(gender[1])
print(gender[2])
print(gender[-1])
```

This is the same as before. We can access individual values starting with index = 0 for the first value. A nice feature of Python is that you can access the last value in the list by setting the index = -1.

Lastly, we can do the same for the country column and just make a list. Note, country values are strings as they are words or groups of words:

```
# country list
country = ["South Africa","Botswana","South Africa","South Africa","Kenya","Mozambique","Lesotho","Kenya","Kenya","Egypt","Sudan"]
```

Run the code below:

```
country = ["South Africa","Botswana","South Africa","South Africa","Kenya","Mozambique","Lesotho","Kenya","Kenya","Egypt","Sudan"]

print(country)
print(country[0])
print(country[5])
```

### Lists

Lists have many features. We will be covering some of them in this lesson.

A list can also contain all kinds of data types, run the following code:

```
# Data Storage With Lists
my_list = [42, -2021, 6.283,"tau", "node"]
print(my_list)
```

We can do many things with lists:

- print all the items in the list using [:]
- we can add items to the end of the list using append()
- add items at specific positions using insert()
- remove an item from the list using the remove() function
- check how many variables are in the list using the len()
- print a range of values using [start:end] – just like in excel!

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/64da2ec3-8f5b-4d51-bb55-dda385749d15)

Let us see some examples of this. Run the code below:

```
# Data Storage With Lists
my_list = [42, -2021, 6.283,"tau", "node"]
print(my_list) 
print(my_list[:])

my_list.append("pi")
print(my_list)

my_list.insert(1,"pi2")
print(my_list)

my_list.remove("pi")
my_list.remove("pi2")
my_list.remove("tau")
print(my_list)
print(len(my_list))

# View a certain range of items:
print(my_list[0:3]
```

When we are getting only a certain range of values from a list we call this list slicing. We can do a lot of cool things with lists like sorting, and joining. Please note, like with any tool, this data type has its limitations. You will learn over time to use the best data type for the right task.

### Dictionaries

A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. Dictionaries are also known as associative arrays or hash maps. They are similar to lists, but instead of using integer indices to access elements, you use keys. It is an unordered data type that is structured using keys and values and is defined with curly brackets {}. Where keys are like the column names and values are the lists of data.

The syntax for creating a dictionary is as follows:

```
d = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
```

Here's an example of how you can use a dictionary to store information about a person:

```
person = {'name': 'John Doe', 'age': 30, 'address': '123 Main St.'}
print(person['name']) # 'John Doe'
print(person.get('age')) # 30
person['phone'] = '555-555-5555'
```

In this example, the dictionary "person" contains three key-value pairs: name, age, address, and phone. You can access the values using the keys, add a new key-value pair and remove an existing key-value pair.

Dictionaries are commonly used in Python to store and organize data, and they can be very useful when working with large amounts of data, because you can quickly look up values by key without having to iterate through the entire data set.

## 4. Reading In Files With Pandas

Create a new file called `pandas01.py` and input the following code in the file and run it:

```
import pandas as pd

file = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_data/main/country_data.csv")

print(file)
```

You should see the following output in the console:

```
    Age Gender       Country
0    39      M  South Africa
1    25      M      Botswana
2    29      F  South Africa
3    46      M  South Africa
4    22      F         Kenya
5    35      F    Mozambique
6    22      F       Lesotho
7    49      M         Kenya
8    30      M         Kenya
9    40      F         Egypt
10   30      M         Sudan
```

And if you click on your "variable explorer" above the console you should see a variable called "file":

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/9e9e4c02-b3aa-4ffd-947a-51cfb07aee6e)

Double click on "file" in the "variable explorer" and you should see your data in a spreadsheet format:

![image](https://github.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_notes/assets/157092105/3511f2a9-7ffd-446c-858d-276f0aebc49f)

And that is it, with 3 lines of code you read in a csv file in Python that you normally would open up in Excel.

Now let us explain the code:

`import pandas as pd`: This line imports the pandas library and gives it the alias 'pd' for easier reference in the code. Pandas is a powerful library in Python used for data manipulation and analysis.

`file = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_data/main/country_data.csv")`: This line reads a CSV file from a specified URL and assigns the resulting data to the variable named 'file'. The CSV file contains country data on a website, you can also open files locally on your computer. Also You can read in a variety of different types of files as shown on the Pandas official website: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/io.html

`print(file)`: This line prints the content of the 'file' variable to the console. It will display the data from the CSV file in a structured format, as pandas typically represents data in tabular form.

Now try out these data sets yourself by replacing url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_data/main/country_data.csv" with the following:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_data/main/movie_dataset.csv

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_data/main/residentdoctors.csv

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_data/main/Geospatial%20Data.csv

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_data/main/student-mat.csv

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChpcTraining/css2024_data/main/GenoType%20Dataset.csv
