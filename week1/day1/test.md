Just like in excel where we are storing numbers in cells we can also store numbers in Python as variables. So for example we have at cell B2 is equal to 30, cell B3 is equal to 40, and so on. Run the code below:

```
# Storing Data
B1 = 30
B2 = 40
B3 = 30
B4 = 49

print(B1)
print(B2)
```

Try storing the rest of the variables that we got from the excel dataset in column B and print them out too.
