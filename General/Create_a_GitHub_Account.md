# Create a Github Account

## What is GitHub

GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps people store and manage any type of file, specifically their code. It allows them to track and control changes that may happen and collaborate with others too. It is used mostly by software developers and engineers, and since your learning to code it is a useful tool to learn. We will only be using a few features of it to give an idea of its usage. If you already have GitHub account then you can ignore this setup and use your existing GitHub account for the course.

You will need a GitHub account for this course.

On the top right of your screen you should see a plus "+" symbol and then a drop down option, click on New repository:

A repository is just like a folder that you create on Windows where you keep files and more folders. You can store any type of file in here. We will be storing some text documents, csv file and our Python code.

For now let us create our first repository by giving it a name like repo01 and then check the box "Add a README file", and click on "Create repository":

You should now see the following:

There are only a few things you need to pay attention too for now:

1. This is the URL or link to you repository that you can share with anyone and they will see the contents of it since you made this a public repository

2. This shows you all the files currently in you repository. There is currently only one, the "README.md" file which by default is always there and is used as a text document that contains

information about the repository and the other files in the directory.

3. This shows the symbol to edit the file

Now click on the pencil icon to edit the file in a text format called Markdown - which you don't have to worry about for now. This opens up a file editor, where you can type and even add images to the file. Edit the file to add "Welcome to the coding summer school":

Then click on "Commit changes", this is like saving a file:

Click on "Commit changes" and then you should see this in your repo:

That is all you need to know for now! Feel free to explore GitHub and its features.
