# Welcoming

Welcome to the Coding Summer School 2024. 

We have 30 research institutes in South Africa who will be part of the school as well as universities from neighbouring countries.
We have over 800 postgraduate students and professionals who will taking part.

The Coding Summer School (CSS) is jointly organised by the Centre for High Performance Computing (CHPC) of the CSIR and the National Institute for Theoretical Computational Science (NITheCS). This joint effort was specifically motivated by a concept paper of the South African Department of Science and Innovation (DSI) that explores the possibility to broaden the scope of NITheP into a national institute/centre for theoretical and computational science. This is the 14th year an event of this kind has happened through the CHPC and 6th year in collaboration with NITheCS

We are all excited for you to join this landmark summer school!

Have a look below at all the different institutes involved:

Why Learn Coding for Postgraduates in STEM Fields

Coding skills are essential for many fields in STEM, including data science, bioinformatics, computer science, and engineering. Having knowledge of coding allows you to analyze and manipulate large data sets, develop models and simulations, and automate repetitive tasks.

Coding can also help you to communicate your research more effectively. For example, you can create interactive visualizations, web applications, and simulations to communicate your findings to a wider audience.

Coding can help you to develop problem-solving skills. Coding requires logical thinking and the ability to decompose a problem into smaller, manageable parts. These skills are transferable to other areas of your research.

Coding can help you to collaborate more effectively. Many research projects involve collaboration, and having coding skills can help you to work more effectively with other researchers. Additionally, coding is a universal language that can help you to communicate with researchers from different backgrounds.

Lastly, coding skills are highly valued in industry, so learning to code can open up new career opportunities after graduation.

The coding or programming language we will be using in this school is Python. It is widely considered to be one of the best programming languages for those in the field of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) due to its simplicity, versatility, and popularity in the field. It has a large and active community, which provides a wealth of libraries and resources for scientific computing, data analysis, machine learning, and visualization. Additionally, Python's readability and ease of use make it a great choice for postgraduates who may be new to programming or who want to quickly prototype and test ideas. We will cover more of this when we begin formal lessons.

Although Python is the primary programming language you will learn, there is "another" one which you will learn called Bash. Which is not technically a programming language but a command-line shell. However, it allows us to interact with an operating system and automate tasks and perform file management effectively. It is also useful to know since its required to use HPC (High Performance Computing) systemts. More on this later.


# Content Covered:

## Week 1:

The first week of the CSS focuses on an introduction to the Python programming language through data science principles. This allow students new to Python an easier transition since we start with performing simple tasks using Excel spreadsheets to doing the same and more tasks in Python.

Python:

What is Python
How to install and run Python Code
Excel to Python
Basic usage
Scripts & Variables
Data Storage
Text & Strings
ETL - Extract Transform Load
EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis

Linux/Bash:

What is Linux and Bash
Running a Bash Terminal
File Management

Teachers:

Mr Binjamin ("Binyamin") Barsch
Ms Nomlie Mfuphi
Mr Mthetho Sovara
Dr Kevin Colville 

## Week 2 

Main topics:

Machine Learning (Mon & Tues)
Probability Theory and Statistics (Wed)

Parallel topics (Thurs & Fri):

Numerical Computations: Numpy Introduction
Sympy
Biomedical / Bioinformatics Sciences
Computational Chemistry / Material science
Ordinary Differential Equations
Common Astronomy Software Applications: CASA Introduction
Mathematical Proofs

Teachers:

Prof Ilya Sinayskiy (UKZN and NITheCS)
Dr Paul van Staden (UP)
Prof Francesco (NITheCS and SUN)
Prof Uwe Jaekel (Hochschule Koblenz, University of Applied Sciences)
Dr Graeme Pleasance (NITheCS, Stellenbosch)
Prof Uwe Jaekel (Hochschule Koblenz, University of Applied Sciences)
Dr Andrew Gill (SUN)
Prof Mattia Vaccari (UCT)

In-person lessons and tutorials will be held to put the material into practice. The School is structured in such a way to encourage students to actively solve challenging problems that the lectures will pose. Students should be prepared to learn on their own!

# School Structure

Daily lectures and interactive tutorials
Notes, quizzes, and assignments provided
Practice all the code examples in the notes
Code out the quiz questions to work out the answer
Go through all content and mark the page as done
Zoom used for live streaming
Zoom recordings of the live lessons will be provided at the end of the day
The content will be made available the previous day
Slack used as official communication medium
Github used as code repository

# Course Preparation

Before the course begins you need to complete all the steps in the section "Course Preparation (Completed Before 29 Jan 2024 09:00)". Where you need to

1. make sure you have Python Software Setup and Linux Software Setup ready and setup

2. you have created a Create a Github Account if you don't have one already

3. gone through the Pre-Course Training: Python Basics notes and tried the examples

4. completed the Pre-Course Python Quiz 1

All before the 28 Jan 2024 @ 23:59

Without completing these 4 steps you will not be able to continue with the school.
