# Linux Software Setup

## Terminals in Windows

There are many ways to run a simulated Linux terminal in Windows and evening installing Linux inside windows through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). For this school we try a simpler approach.

We will use GitBash which comes pre-installed if you install Git. This can be obtained by clicking on the link: [download link](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.43.0.windows.1/Git-2.43.0-64-bit.exe)https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.43.0.windows.1/Git-2.43.0-64-bit.exe

Once downloaded it should appear in your downloads folder:

Double click on the app to run the application. You should see the following in which you select Next:

Choose the destination where you want to install it, preferably stick with the default C:/ drive location and select Next:

For next two windows that appear just select Next:

For "default editor" choose "Nano" editor and then Next

## Terminal in Linux

You don't need to install the bash terminal in Linux it comes pre-installed. Search for your Terminal in your start up menu. For example using the Linux flavour Mint or Ubuntu:

Once you have a terminal open you are ready to start the next part of the course as all commands provided in the course material will be executed in this terminal.

## Terminal on a Mac

You don't need to install the bash terminal on Mac, a similar one called ZSH comes pre-installed. Click on your launchpad:
