# Python Software

There are many ways to run Python code. It can be run on a very basic terminal or in an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). There are many IDEs to choose from but for this course we are using Spyder.

## Windows - Spyder

There are 100's of ways to run Python code on various platforms and environments. From your PC to your web browser, to your Linux terminal. We will be using one of the most well known Python platforms known as Anaconda. If you are familiar with Python and have it installed already then use what you are comfortable with.

If you don't have Python installed and this is your first time with Python then follow the following steps:

To install Anaconda, go to this link - https://www.anaconda.com/products/distributionLinks to an external site. and click on the Download button:

By default, the option is for Windows, however you can install it on Linux and MacOS.

Once it has finished installing, open and run the file. You should then see the following, select Next:

You will see the installation process. Note, it can take some time - up to 10 minutes or more. Once done select Next:

You will see many programmes that Anaconda has installed for you including Python. All focused on data science. We will will be using the Spyder Python environment. It has one very useful feature called the variable explorer which is like a an excel sheet built into the environment so you can see your data and interact with it. It is also very similar to Matlab. Select Spyder, wait for it to load and then you will see the following:

# Python Libraries

FYI, this is only necessary if your familiar with Python and want to install individual Python libraries. The ones used are:

- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- sympy
- sklearn

Note, these are all installed by default with Anaconda. For other libraries like tensorflow you can go to the Anaconda Environment tab and install them there or use the Anaconda console. If you are using a Python console you can use pip install tensorflow for example.
